# CancerMortalityrate
Cancer mortality rate prediction in US counties using different Regression methods.

# Objective:
The objective of this project is to predict cancer mortality rates using data from several counties in the United States. In this presentation, I will show you how I designed my solution to predicting cancer mortality rates using a machine learning algorithm.

# Type of Task:
This task would fall into supervised learning because the model would be trained with labelled examples and each instance comes with an expected output.

# How will model performance be measured?
My solution for predicting cancer mortality rates will be using the root mean squared error performance measure. I have selected this performance measure because it is the performance measure I am most familiar with using, and for many, it is the performance measure of choice for regression-based machine learning algorithms.

# Obtaining and Downloading Data
The dataset being used for this solution will be the OLS Regression challenge dataset collected and formed by the user Noah Rippner from https://data.world/. The exact dataset can be found in the following hyperlink. https://data.world/nrippner/ols-regression-challenge
